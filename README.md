Food Hero is a web app that aids in the fight against hunger and the elimination of food waste. The MVP of this product enables restaurants and grocers to upload inventories of food that they would otherwise throw out, and list their location so that it can be picked up by a Food Hero (volunteer) to take to an organization (e.g. Food Bank) that will distribute it to those in need. It is a full-stack React Application with a Mongo backend.
